[Quick Start Guide]


1.Create a new Unity project.

Because this asset is created in a linear color space, I recommend that you change Edit → ProjectSetting → Player → Other Settings / Rendering → Color Space to "Linear" before importing it.

2.Importing VirtualComfortRoomEdge

3.Import Post Processing Stack V2

-Before 2017
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PostProcessing/releases/
Download and install from here

-For 2018 and beyond
Please install Post Processing from Window → PackageManager


4.Open the Scene file.

Assets/VirtualFoxDesignStudio/VirtualComfortRoomEdge/SCENE
Open the scene within.

[VirtualComfortRoomEdge_FullLightBake]
Here's a scene with a finely burned light map. Use this if you want to use it without moving the object.

[VirtualComfortRoomEdge_ProbeLighting]
The light probe lighting leaves no baked shadows even when small objects are moved. If you want to remove the canvas or cushions and use them, please use this option.



-"Post-process Volume_ForMovie" in the scene is Editor Only and is for demo purposes. Please note that it is not displayed when you build.
